Plotter code
============

This is the code inside the plotter chip, which drives the hardware components (motors and servo-motor).

Move the SDFiles folder content in your SD card.

The "config" file is the default values for a A4 sheet with 190cm between motors. Edit it for an other configuration.
The "drawing" file is a test sheet with simple shapes. You must name all your drawings as "drawing" to draw it.

DraWall
=======

DraWall is a vertical plotter. More informations are available here -> http://www.drawall.cc (currently in french).

This project is a work in progress. A stable release will be published soon.
